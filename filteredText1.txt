A very, very, slow-moving, aimless movie distressed, drifting young man. 0
Not sure lost - flat characters audience, nearly half walked out. 0
Attempting artiness black & white clever camera angles, movie disappointed - became even ridiculous - acting poor plot lines almost non-existent. 0
Very little music anything speak of. 0
The best scene movie Gerardo trying find song keeps running head. 1
The rest movie lacks art, charm, meaning... If emptiness, works I guess empty. 0
Wasted two hours. 0
Saw movie today thought good effort, good messages kids. 1
A bit predictable. 0
Loved casting Jimmy Buffet science teacher. 1
And baby owls adorable. 1

It Was So Cool. 1
This "right case" movie delivers everything almost right face. 1
It average acting main person, low budget clearly see. 0
This review long overdue, since I consider A Tale Two Sisters single greatest film ever made. 1
I'll put gem movie terms screenplay, cinematography, acting, post-production, editing, directing, aspect film-making. 1
It's practically perfect  true masterpiece sea faux "masterpieces. 1
" The structure film easily tightly constructed history cinema. 1
I think film something vitally important occurs every minute. 1
In words, content level film enough easily fill dozen films. 1
How anyone right mind ask anything movie this? 1
It's quite simply highest, superlative form cinema imaginable. 1
Yes, film require rather significant amount puzzle-solving, pieces fit together create beautiful picture. 1
This short film certainly pulls punches. 0
Graphics far best part game. 0
This number one best TH game series. 1
It deserves strong love. 1
It insane game. 1
There massive levels, massive unlockable characters... massive game. 1
Waste money game. 1
This kind money wasted properly. 1
Actually, graphics good time. 1
Today graphics crap. 0
As say Canada, This fun game, aye. 1
This game rocks. 1
Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it. 1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE. 1
This flick doomed conception. 0
The idea lame - take minor character mediocre PG-13 film, make complete non-sequel changing tone PG-rated family movie. 0
I least bit interested. 0
Not confirm film would unfunny generic, also managed give away ENTIRE movie; I'm exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke told trailer. 0
But funny. 0
But even talented Carrell can't save this. 0
His co-stars fare much better, people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill, Ed Helms wasted. 0
The story predictable lazy. 0
The real effects work presence animals, integration scenes worst obvious blue/green-screen work I've ever seen. 0
But whatever cost much, translate quality, that's sure. 0
The film succeeds despite, perhaps of, obviously meagre budget. 1
I'm glad film go obvious choice, lesser film certainly would have. 1
In addition one lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one cutest leading ladies ever grace screen. 1
It's hard fall head-over-heels love girl. 1
On negative, insipid enough cause regret another 2 hours life wasted front screen. 0
Long, whiny pointless. 0
But I recommend waiting future efforts, let one go. 0
Excellent cast, story line, performances. 1
Totally believable. 1
Anne Heche utterly convincing. 1
Sam Shepard's portrayal gung ho Marine sobering. 1
I sat riveted TV screen. 1
All I give one resounding 9 10. 1
I think Tom Hanks good actor. 1
I enjoyed reading book children little. 1
I disappointed movie. 0
One character totally annoying voice gives feeling fingernails chalkboard. 0
There totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. 0
There absolutely warmth charm scenes characters. 0
This movie totally grates nerves. 0
The performances improved improvisation, actors twice much worry about: whether they're delivering line well, whether line good. 0
And, quite honestly, often good. 0
Often dialogue really follow one line another, fit surroundings. 0
It crackles unpredictable, youthful energy - honestly, found hard follow concentrate meanders badly. 0
There generally great things it. 1
I say they're worth 2 hours time, though. 0
The suspense builders good, & cross line G PG. 1
I especially liked non-cliche choices parents; movies, I could predict dialog verbatim, writing movie made better selections. 1
If want movie that's gross gives chills, great choice. 1
Alexander Nevsky great film. 1
He amazing film artist, one important whoever lived. 1
I'm glad pretentious piece s*** planned Dodge stratus Big Shots... It's gonna help movie makers restrained "movie business" Québec. 0
This first movie I've given 10 years. 1
If ever movie needed word-of-mouth promote, it. 1
Overall, film interesting thought-provoking. 1
Plus, well-paced suited relatively short run time. 1
Give one look. 1
I gave 10 1
The Wind Lion well written superbly acted. 1
It true classic. 1
It actually turned pretty decent far B-list horror/suspense films go. 1
Definitely worth checking out. 1
The problem script. 0
It horrendous. 0
There NOTHING believable all. 0
The suspense I feeling frustration retarded girls were. 0
MANNA FROM HEAVEN terrific film predictable unpredictable time. 1
The scenes often funny occasionally touching characters evaluate lives going. 1
The cast veteran actors nostalgia trip. 1
Ursula Burton's portrayal nun touching funny time making fun nuns church. 1
If looking movie terrific cast, good music(including Shirley Jones rendition "The Way You Look Tonight"), uplifting ending, give one try. 1
I think disappointed. 1
Frankly, Cotton club Unfaithful, kind embarrassing watch Lane Gere film, BAD. 0
The acting bad, dialogs extremely shallow insincere. 0
It predictable, even chick flick. 0
Too politically correct. 0
Very disappointing. 0
The thing really worth watching scenery house, beautiful. 1
I love Lane, I've never seen movie lousy. 0
An hour half I wish I could bring back. 0
But terms writing fresh bold. 1
The acting helps writing along well (maybe idiot-savant sister could played better), real joy watch. 1
The directing cinematography quite good. 0
The movie boring, I sometimes found occupied peaking paper instead watching (never happened Columbo movie before! 0
), sometimes embarrassing I look away. 0
The directing seems pretentious. 0
The scenes "oh-so-mature" neighbour-girl misplace. 0
And generally lines plot weaker average episode. 0
Then scene debated whether sack trumpeter (who falsely accused murder) pure horror, really stupid. 0
Some applause given "prelude" however. 1
I really liked that. 1
A great film great director. 1
The movie edge seat made somewhat afraid go car end night. 1
The music film really nice too. 1
I'd advise anyone go see it. 1
Brilliant! 1
10/10 1
I liked movie way much. 1
My problem I thought actor playing villain low rent Michael Ironside. 0
It rocked world certainly must see anyone social physical outlets. 1
However, make fact overall, tremendously boring movie. 0
There NO chemistry Ben Affleck Sandra Bullock film, I understand would consider even leaving wife-to-be chick supposedly knocked by. 0
There several moments movie need excruciatingly slow moving. 0
This poor remake "My Best Friends Wedding". 0
All all, great disappointment. 0
I cannot believe actors agreed "film". 0
I could stand even watch long fear losing I.Q. 0
I guess nobody network aired dribble watched putting on. 0
IMDB ratings go low 1 awful, time get negative numbers cases these. 0
I saw "Mirrormask" last night unsatisfactory experience. 0
Unfortunately, inexperience direction meant scene scene passed little way dramatic tension conflict. 0
These central themes film handled ineptly, stereotypically depth imagination. 0
All pretty pictures world cannot make piece work flawed core. 0
It hour half waste time, following bunch pretty high schoolers whine cry life. 0
You can't relate them, hell barely understand them. 0
This definitely cult classic well worth viewing sharing others. 1
This movie pure disaster, story stupid editing worst I seen, confuses incredibly. 0
The fish badly made underwater shots repeated thousand times film. 0
A truly, truly bad film. 0
The acting terrible, writing worse. 0
The possible way movie could redeemed would MST3K fodder. 0
I paid much. 0
Also, real treat see Anthony Quinn playing Crazy Horse. 1
It BORING! 0
No plot whatsoever! 0
Again, plot all. 0
Horrible! 0
Worst hour half life!Oh gosh! 0
I walk theatre minutes get relief! 0
I hate movies like that. 0
Yeah, movie pretty much sucked. 0
THERE IS NO PLOT OR STORYLINE!! 0
If go see movie, bring pillow girlfriend/boyfriend keep occupied out. 0
Awful. 0
I think I've ever gone movie disliked much. 0
It good thing tickets cost five dollars I would mad I'd paid $7.50 see crap. 0
NOBODY identifies characters they're cardboard cutouts stereotypes (or predictably reverse-stereotypes). 0
This bad film, bad writing, good actors....an ugly cartoon crafted Paul Haggis people can't handle anything bold strokes storytelling....a picture painted crayons. 0
Crash depressing little nothing, provokes emotion, teaches nothing already know racism prejudice bad things. 0
Still, I like movie empowerment women; there's enough movies like one. 1
Your brain attempt shut-down part primal impulse self-preservation. 0
I left shattered experience watching 'film' I took good two hours fully recover. 0
This movie joins Revenge Boogeyman Zombiez part hellish trinity horror films. 0
I certainly mean distinction good way. 0
I mean terrible way. 0
This film redeeming features. 0
Everything appalling. 0
Artless camera-work endlessly presents us ugliest setting imaginable, i.e. 0
The story beyond stupid. 0
The script iswas script? 0
The kids annoying. 0
The lead man charisma-free. 0
Utterly without merit level, akin torture. 0
I'll even say  torture. 0
Maybe would reasonable explanation atrocity. 0
Not pleasant voyage self-discovery. 0
Highly unrecommended. 0
If premise sound stupid, that's is. 0
Yes, bad. 0
Nothing recommend. 0
An excellent performance Ms. 1
Garbo, showed right bat talents could carry silent era (I wanted see silent work, Netflix seem stocking them. 1
It's also great see renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion missed step going silent sound. 1
This movie suffered writing, needed suspense. 0
There many close ups. 0
But movie seemed drag heroes really work freedom. 0
But movie definitely average rent. 0
"You'll love it! 1
This movie BAD. 0
So bad. 0
The film way long. 0
This definitely one bad ones. 0
The movie I received great quality film age. 1
John Wayne incredible job young movie industry. 1
His screen presence shined thought even though senior actors screen him. 1
I think must see older John Wayne film. 1
I really see anyone could enjoy movie. 0
I think I've ever seen movie half boring self-indulgent piece junk. 0
It probably would better director spent movie showcasing art work, really noteworthy. 0
Another thing I really like character got punched face, gallon blood would spew forth soon after. 0
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles. 1
His performance simply genius. 1
He owns film, Spacek owned "Coal Miner's Daughter" Quaid owned "Great Balls Fire. 1
" In fact, hard remember part Ray Charles acted, played man himself. 1
Ray Charles legendary. 1
Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material film, goes well beyond another movie musician. 1
Hitchcock great director. 1
Ironically I mostly find films total waste time watch. 0
Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected thriller chase movie. 1
It's pandering audience sabotages films. 0
Hence whole story lacks certain energy. 0
The plot simply rumbles like machine, desperately depending addition new scenes. 0
There usual Hitchcock logic flaws. 0
Mishima extremely uninteresting. 0
This chilly, unremarkable movie author living/working chilly abstruse culture. 0
The flat reenactments hold attention emotionally adrift stagy. 0
And rest sits awful... soldiers singing songs masculinity pledge to, hairsplitting purity, admiration swords, etc. 0
He bore pieces, kill momentum movie, quicker anyone else. 0
Schrader made resume full lousy, amateurish films. 0
When I first watched movie, 80s, I loved it. 1
I totally fascinated music, dancing... everything. 1
However, I recently watched whole thing DVD, I completely struck extremely stupid storyline - contained holes, inconsistencies - frankly - whole lot crap - horrid dancing was. 0
I mean, realistic world, would NEVER gotten ballet repertory... The whole thing quite pathetic. 0
The character developments also lacked depth. 0
Woa, talk awful. 0
Do waste time. 0
It horrible. 0
The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on. 0
But really made unwatchable direction. 0
The poor actors. 0
You can't even tell talent pathetic lines speak director gave action. 0
If check director's filmography site see film chance. 0
This would even good made TV flick. 0
If good intentions made film great, film might one greatest films ever made. 1
The film great actors, master director, significant theme--at least would-be significant theme, undertone fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes ought thrilled senses imagination, characters one might deeply care. 1
Regrettably, film fails. 0
The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression feeling, celebration patriotism underlines narrative. 0
No actress worse used June Allison movie. 0
Yet, I enjoy watching it. 1
Unfortunately, bad movie plain bad. 0
Bad script, bad direction horrible acting make one plain bad! 0
The dialogue sucked. 0
The cinematography-if called that-sucked. 0
The soundtrack sucked. 0
The acting sucked. 0
The concert sequences sucked. 0
That nice. 1
That funny. 1
It funny. 1
Overall, movie cheap trash. 0
But movie funny, considering ridiculousness it. 0

***SPOILERS*** Whatever else (or can't) said it, SURFACE superbly crafted. 1
The cinematography simply stunning (to say least) fx nothing state-of-the-art. 1
Conceptually, show offers little bit everything- everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans). 1
And single sour note struck acting-wise, either; surprisingly solid casting, here. 1
All things considered, job well done. 1

The plot pretty much every cheap horror. 0
There pathetic attempts give characters depth, really work rest plot. 0

I highly recommend movie anyone interested art, poetry, theater, politics, Japanese history. 1
Here, The Wind Lion, see wonderful rendering America's Imperial age. 1
) What makes story different terrific production values - faultless photography, composition editing - terrific casting - underappreciated Brian Keith playing bully Teddy - vivid history. 1
Though The Wind Lion told largely eyes son, every member family identify one characters, whether Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick". 1
This high adventure best. 1
I think Robert Ryans best film, portrayed someone like father, schizophrenic real life,(my father) although never murdered anyone affected second world war made worse. 1
Having humour get get day apt. 1
(My mother brother this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying type man, good imitation type individual, I impressed. 1
Almost songs Cover Girl old-fashioned tuneful. 0
The annoying thing 'Cover Girl' way Rita Hayworth put pedestal. 0
Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' example Hollywood used exploit women financial gain. 0
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks every part articulated quite well. 1
The good cinematography also makes Monica Bellucci look beautiful. 1
A good commentary today's love undoubtedly film worth seeing. 1

I wish I could enter negative values, admins? 0
The sets bad, look place Thunderbirds episode. 0
The use slow-motion needlessly repeats throughout movie well backed bad acting (and bad kind word here), continuity, scenes thrown reason whatsoever, vehicles looked like made Corn Flakes box directorial style bordered stupidity. 0
Oh yeah, storyline pathetic too. 0
I hate writing bad reviews films - especially I really like star - film bad I believe one second anyone could proud it. 0
I filmmaker I director I would hide head sand I'd spent whatever amount money time movie. 0
In short - monumental waste time energy I would recommend anyone EVER see film. 0
It came free DVD player I bought I still turned thing halfway I embarrassed Howell. 0
1/10 - setting 0/10. 0
An interesting premise, Billy Drago always good dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love see Drago, Stephen McHattie Lance Hendrikson flick together; talk raging cheekbones!). 1
The soundtrack terrible, either. 1
But acting--even professionals Drago Debbie Rochon--was terrible, directing worse (perhaps contributory former), dialog chimp-like, camera work, barely tolerable. 0
Still, SETS got big "10" "oy-vey" scale. 1
Yes, I simplifying things sake brevity, really core problems film - much going without real, fulfilling explanation. 0
Both good jobs quite amusing. 1
But convoluted plot convince me, much film watched weird, questioning glance. 0
I let girlfriend talk seeing - bad idea, hated it. 0
The last 15 minutes movie also bad well. 1
Bela Lugosi totally extraneous, intoning odd lines. 0
The acting decidely wooden, though worse period Universal B movie. 0
I like Armand Assante & cable company's summary sounded interesting, I watched it, twice already, probably again. 1
I believe screenwriter good job tying loose ends. 1
My 8/10 score mostly plot. 1
I say - I like spoilers, I want one, I believe film worth time. 1
Wow, bad film. 0
Not frightening least, barely comprehensible. 0
The plot hang together all, acting absolutely appalling. 0
Not even good camp value! 0
I expecting Oscar material, this? 0
You'd IQ particularly stupid mollusk see one coming. 0
This film (and I use word loosely) insult movie-going public. 0
If someone involved knew string together narrative! 0
This gets 1 10, simply there's nothing lower. 0
This one I have, I watched recently Fox Movie Channel, disappointed. 0
I know contract player little control scripts, acting bad script. 0
Victor McLaglen even bad, Brian DonLevy almost unrecognizable. 0
Considering relations screen Taylor Stanwyck, surprising little chemistry screen two them. 0
But premise film ridiculous: President U.S. 0
The death row scenes entirely unmoving. 0
The thing worse Taylor's acting Stanwyck's singing. 0
Whatever producer going for, missed entirely. 0
I deeply impressed character played. 1
I knew I saw film great things come gifted actor. 1
A cheap cheerless heist movie poor characterisation, lots underbite style stoic emoting (think Chow Yun Fat A Better Tomorrow) cheesy clichés thrown abandoned factory ready poorly executed flying judo rolls la John Woo. 0
Even squibs look awful. 0
At point proceedings look remotely like America. 0
The plot, is, derivative predictable ending like mercy killing. 0
The awful dialogue hopeless overacting everyone gets shot top real waste space time. 0
I uneasy bad movie was, scared all. 0
The dialogue composed things make little sense. 0
About 30 minutes footage wasted show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough make teen Goth blush, almost always Olde English, sometimes Latin may may made words. 0
The directing sloppy best. 0
Hackneyed writing, certainly, made even worse bad directing. 0
Of course, acting blah. 0
The acting whole cast could put scale balanced perfectly overacting underacting. 0
And, FINALLY, that, get ending would've great handled competent people Jerry Falwell. 0
I loved movie great portrayal family share ups down, end knew special love other. 1
I seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, god one best, though came 12 years ago. 1
This movie contained all-star cast, I loved opened eyes see actors I seen before. 1
This movie kind long length, I enjoyed every minute it. 1
Overall I rate movie 10 1-10 scale. 1
Lifetime air enough, anyone knows store sells let know must-have. 1
I particularly remember senses assaulted strident cords music would blare little warning, even less meaning. 0
It sort pap screened afternoon punish unemployed jobs. 0
Totally different, loads understatement black comedy, film get see, remember it. 1
This movie creates universe, fascinating every way. 1
But movie really got me. 1
See it. 1
I really hope team behind movie makes movies, continue own, kinda weird style. 1
And I forgot: The Casting superb, Trond Fausa Aurvåg perfect role Bothersome Man, understand is, why. 1
This movie good humorous comment life 2006. 1
I found move beautiful, enjoyable, uplifting. 1
Initially local sites film, filmed Buffalo, intrigued me. 1
Later I found lost power film. 1
The entire audience applauded conclusion film. 1
I left theater lilt step, joy heart hope human race. 1
Duris wholesome appearance gives fine performance. 1
The rest cast also play well. 1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views Barcelona famed Gaudi towers. 1
About ten minutes film I started second thoughts. 0
About half way film I started dislike it. 0
By time film ended, I disliked it, I despised it. 0
What film lacks convincing script. 0
The script looks rough draft written shooting began finished script completed. 0
Things happen, characters personalities change, plot twists occur real reason script calls it. 0
The cast good. 1
For that, worth checking out. 1
This probably irritating show I ever seen entire life. 0
It indescribably annoying idiotic show I ever seen. 0
Everything bad. 0
I could understand, kind idiot would produce mess first place mention several season. 0

Final Word: This Show real torture!! 0
It zillion times away reality. 0
Watching washing machine twirling around hurt eyes much show. 0
Rating: 0/10 (Grade: Z) Note: The Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Of The Cast Pull Her Daughter Out Of The Show. 0
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) quite silly noir implausible unmitigated bore movie. 0
Full unconvincing cardboard characters blandly written Edward Chodorov, also produced, surprisingly directed Jean Negulesco one would expect great deal more. 0
From Widmark character turns unintentionally comical! 0
His losing marbles early proceedings totally implausible unconvincing. 0
And enough mess movie - picture also marred constant use studio sets indoor exteriors. 0

STEAMBOAT WILLIE amazingly important film cinema history. 1
This second appearance Mickey Mouse (following silent PLANE CRAZY earlier year) probably famous film--mostly ground-breaking. 1
While yet hear Mickey speak, tons sound effects music throughout film--something take granted huge crowd pleaser 1928. 1
However, seeing short 25 years, I amazed timeless film actually is. 1
It's adorable seeing Mickey playing "Turkey Straw" highly imaginative (if occasionally cruel) way. 1
Clever real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even 80 wonderful years. 1
The bipolarity ruthless thug (one minute ruthless killer, next minute Luv's diaper commercial) completely unconvincing. 0
I'm terribly disappointed film would receive many awards accolades, especially far deserving works film there. 0
The original Body Soul (1947) masterpiece. 1
John Garfield, Ann revere, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee...and filmed one greatest cinematographers ever grace screen..James Wong Howe. 1
I think redeeming qualities remake. 0
This may bad film ever made. 0
So bad...well...it's bad. 0
This movie solid example bad plot very, bad idea way. 0
It's shame see good actors like Thomerson James make living mess like this. 0
I thought bad. 0
Both films terrible, credit 1986 version, watchable. 0
Let's start problemsthe acting, especially lead professor, very, bad. 0
The script big flawed mess. 0

Director Paul Matthews, also wrote/directed weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly know pace films. 0
The movie terribly boring places. 0
The lighting awful. 0
The film looks cheap bland. 0
One disappointing aspects lack notable gore. 0
This convention never worked well past, certainly work here. 0
The visual effects AWFUL. 0
The CG opening sequence space looked like could created Microsoft Slideshow God's sake! 0
The "explosion" Gas tanks end awful. 0
Okay, I like consider fair critic, I'll give credit credit's due--the creature effects actually pretty cool. 1
Gotta love close-ups slimy, drooling teeth! 1
To sum film up, "Breeders" terrible, cheaply made horror movie avoided like Ebola virus. 0
Not recommended. 0
He almost unbearable watch screen, little charisma, terrible comedic timing. 0
Aside terrible lead, film loads debits. 0
I understand supposed cheap popcorn comedy, mean completely insult intelligence, writing incredibly hackneyed borders offensive. 0
Lewis Black's considerable talent wasted too, incendiary unrestrained, PG-13 rating certainly allow. 0
The film's sole bright spot Jonah Hill (who look almost unrecognizable fans recent Superbad due amount weight lost interim). 1
With originality freshness first movie spent, remake little else offer. 0
The budget evidently limited. 0
This reflected cast, also below-par script, borrowed much earlier classic. 0
However, decent acting, action location work balance things up. 0
Filmiing less expansive. 0
It failed convey broad sweep landscapes great part original. 0
Generally; lacked imagination. 0
Not recommended. 0
Is possible movie get worse this? 0
There plot keep going first place. 0
Even women finally show up, sign improvement; expected things happen time film over, might far asleep. 0
Beware: trashy cult movie, trash -period! 0
I can't believe there's even sequel this! 0
Which precisely I giving bad review! 0
Being 90's child, I truly enjoyed show I proudly say I enjoyed big time even classical WB cartoons. 1
But "Tiny Toons" kept 90's vibe delivered one popular, funny, underrated cartoons ever created. 1
The memories murky I say I enjoyed every single episode product related show. 1
Easily, none cartoon made laugh tender way (before getting dark sitcoms oriented teenagers). 1
The characters funny peculiarity true lead character. 1
Every single character hilarious deserved called lead. 1
Every element story top, excessively phony contrived painful sit through. 0
Her lines seem WRITTEN fifteen year old, though trying oh so, hard sound like fifteen year old would really, um, know, well... talk. 0
Perabo nice energy level obviously comfortable front camera. 1
There simply excuse something poorly done. 0
I saw movie I thought stupid movie. 0
What even stupid thought idea volcano Los Angeles? 0
To honest you, unbelievable nonsense foolish. 0
In conclusion, I bother movie volcano Los Angeles nothing nonsense. 0
The story line awful! 0
It's painful! 0
And accents absolutely abysmal! 0
There's also enough hypocrisy film make vomit. 0
Don't waste time watching rubbish non-researched film. 0

Go watch it! 1
Omit watching this. 0
VERY funny! 1
My rating: 3 10. 0
The characters interesting really care them. 1
An instant classic, great soundtrack catchy song ending credits. 1
Don't miss it. 1
This masterful piece film-making, many themes simmering occasionally boiling warts study poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years span aerial bombardments London outward tranquillity Welsh coastal retreat - borderlines friendship, lust love, dedication art experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice egotism versus heroism self-sacrifice more. 1
A mature, subtle script suggests occasionally brings dramatic focus underlying tensions well served perfect performances (apart odd inappropriate smiling Keira Knightley prone to, though perhaps direction time characters often mention it). 1
But exquisite visual composition moment, inventive elegant use close-up, camera angle lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, wonder joy behold. 1
It's continuously beautiful look Bertolucci, relationships convincing narrative engaging master's work. 1
The basic premise wasted since sidelined inexplicable focus documentary crew. 0
Regardless, film fails levels. 0
Avoid costs. 0
I saw film Christmas, great film was! 1
I thought Errol Flynn brilliant Custer since become favourite actor! 1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland brilliant ending fantastic! 1
I always known Errol Flynn brilliant actor dads favourite actor, I grew watching films child. 1
But I watched film I realised great actually was. 1
I'll give film 10 10! 1
I know Jim O'Connor energetic nobody could much him, George well dull. 0
He really seem want hosting; voice-overs monotonous, get involved guests. 0
Lovely little thriller Hitchcock, lots nice shenanigans surrounding murdered spy, kidnapped child, nasty church, foreign plot random taxidermists. 1
Jimmy Stewart ever great hero Hitchcock, story rips along cool climax embassy function, lacks brooding menace Hitchcock's black white, low-budget original. 1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film great master's stable. 1
I say film excellently produced tops ratings typical sci fi film! 1
Excellently produced one Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver ! 1
But entertaining, nonetheless. 1
It's campy sort film that's joy watch. 1
There's barely boring moment film plenty humorous parts. 1
The cast always entertaining usual. 1
Overall, delight! 1
This movie mind-bendingly awful, even created. 0
The film lacks real scares tension & medical terminology used throughout bit iffy say least & I say insulin dependant diabetic myself. 0
The least said acting better. 0

Don't afraid subtitles........ worth little aversion therapy 10/10 1
Excellent performance. 1
There still good actors around! 1
Also great directing photography. 1
Very true Shakespear, 'must' Shakespear fans. 1
Macbeth (Jason Connery) moved tears final monolog (out brief candle, out)He gave sphere moral decay dark forces human face, makes interesting. 1
Helen Baxendale credible lady Macbeth cheerfull times sometimes looks like naughty girl, deadly taste blood evil. 1
If love death decay, Shakespears lyrics... one. 1
This witty delightful adaptation Dr Seuss book, brilliantly animated UPA's finest thoroughly deserving Academy Award. 1
Special mention made superb music score sound effects, integral element helping make memorable enjoyable cartoon. 1
However Paul Schrader indeed made film "about" Mishima superb & complex. 1
Also notable John Bailey's fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography great production design & costumes Eiko Ishioka went memorable costumes Coppola's Dracula received well deserved Oscar. 1
Even allowing poor production values time (1971) format (some kind mini-series), baaaaaad. 0
Unless visually "collect" extant films Austen's work, skip one. 0
If watch it, however, small consolations: The actresses playing Anne's sisters wonderful job roles. 1
It good. 0
Speaking music, unbearably predictably kitchy. 0
Then film dropped ball. 0
This stunning movie. 1
Raw sublimely moving. 1
It felt like gripping, intelligent stage play (but without overly theatrical feeling one actually gets watching people stage) plays everyone's terror white lie escalating monstrous consequences. 1
All main players mesmerising. 1
Tom Wilkinson broke heart end... everyone else's judging amount fumbling hankies hands going faces among males females alike. 1
Julian Fellowes triumphed again. 1
He's national treasure. 1
GO AND SEE IT! 1
This excellent film. 1
The aerial scenes well-done. 1
It also right balance war love. 1
The film gives meaning phrase, "Never history human conflict much owed many few. 1
Kris Kristoffersen good movie really makes difference. 1
A good film great director! 1
This definitely one better documentaries I seen looking family relationships marriage. 1
There many continuity errors: one user commented different cars garage, Joe's glasses...the one got fact Joe's facial hair configuration seemed change scene scene. 0
This great movie. 1
10 10 stars. 1
I can't see movie inspiration anyone come overcome fear rejection. 0
It's bad actually worth seeing reason. 0
Punishment Park brilliant piece cinema. 1
Shot Southern California desert using patent faux documentary style, Watkins creates film like other. 1

Emily Watson's character strong, give quick glance understand everything. 1
Despite pans reviewers, I liked movie. 1
In fact, I liked better Interview With Vampire I liked Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better Cruise's attempt. 1
Aailiyah pretty good Akasha, places compelling (her first entrance mini dance scene). 1
I'm big fan series mostly due Anne Rice's style, sensitivities treatments. 1
